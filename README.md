# üåü Octasol

[Octasol](https://octasol.io/) is a cutting-edge, open-source bounty platform reimagining how open-source projects are managed on GitHub. It connects maintainers with skilled contributors worldwide, making collaboration more efficient and rewarding.

At the heart of Octasol is a **trustless bounty system** that enables maintainers to escrow funds for resolving GitHub issues, rewarding contributors securely and transparently. In addition to the bounty system, we have integrated a **Dev ID platform**, where developers can showcase their proof of work by connecting various coding profiles like GitHub, LeetCode, HackerRank, and more.

üí° **Dev ID System**: The Dev ID allows contributors to consolidate their profiles across multiple platforms, serving as a verified portfolio that can be used to secure future bounties.

## üöÄ How It Works

### üõ†Ô∏è For Maintainers

1. **Post Issues**: Easily post issues from your GitHub repositories and attach bounties to attract skilled contributors.
2. **Escrow Setup**: During negotiations, set up an escrow through Octasol.
3. **Fund Transfer**: If the pull request is merged, the escrowed funds are instantly transferred to the contributor‚Äôs Solana wallet. If the pull request is closed or canceled, the funds are safely returned to your account.

### üåç For Contributors

1. **Signal Interest**: Signal your interest by submitting blank pull requests to issues with bounties.
2. **Negotiate**: Negotiate directly with maintainers to finalize the bounty amount.
3. **Get Paid**: Upon successful merge of your pull request, receive the escrowed funds in your Solana wallet.

### üÜï Dev ID Platform

In addition to the bounty system, Octasol has launched a **Dev ID platform** at [octasol.io](https://octasol.io), where developers can connect various coding and contribution profiles such as:

- GitHub
- LeetCode
- GeeksforGeeks
- HackerRank
- CodeChef
- SuperteamEarn
- Codeforces (coming soon)
- Gitlab (coming soon)

This unified profile serves as **proof of work**, which can be shared with maintainers to increase your chances of winning bounties. Verification is quick and secure via the [**Reclaim Protocol**](https://reclaimprotocol.org/) ‚Äî just scan a QR code, log in through the provided link, and get verified instantly!
